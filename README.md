# HotSoupScript
This library enables programming beginers to make an artistic (especially game) programming easily.  
  
This is inspired by [HSP Language](https://hsp.tv/) which is widely used for kid's coding.

## Examples used HSS
* [Simulation of Newton's Cradle](https://github.com/konbraphat51/NewtonsCradle)

## How To Use
### Set up

[HSS Template](https://github.com/konbraphat51/HSS_Template) could be your help to setup HTML.  
  
Put this repository in your html-existing directory, and write below.
```html
<!--Prepare canvas-->
<canvas id="canvas" width="800" height="600"></canvas>

<!--Call modules-->
<script src="HotSoupScript/ModulesLoader.js"></script>
```
  
If you want to use `async` function, write your main code as this:
```JavaScript
async function main(){...}
```
and, put this **under your main code `src` tag**:
```html
<script src="HotSoupScript/MainCaller.js"></script>
```

This tag call your `main()` async function. (The name should be `main()`)
  
### Coding
Usable function is in `Public` folder. Check it out!
  
Functions starts with `__` means not intended to be used by you :(  
  
Function starts with `async` requires `await`  
```JavaScript
//if the function written like this:
async function a(){...}

//Call the function like this:
await a();
```
  
#### Settings
If you want to change your HTML canvas id (default is `canvas`), modify `HotSoupScript/Public/Settings.js`

#### Graphics
This section may be the essence of this library.  
You may look at `HotSoupScript/Public/Graphics.js`. 
  
Setting colors or any other parameter starts with `Set`,  
and drawing textures starts with `Draw`

#### HTML
This section puts HTML element **below the canvas**. You also can get value.  
If you want to notice if the value changed, use `IsHTMLUpdated()` or `GetUpdatedHTML()`.  You may can use onChanged, but it makes multi-thread which is confusing for beginners.

#### Math / Geometry
A lot of mathmatics. This would be very useful if you can understand. If not, try doing things by your own.

#### Utils
General and helpful functions. Especially these are important:
* `Sleep()`
    Stop the program for miliseconds (1000ms = 1 second). **You will need this when you want a constant loop, or your browser will CRASHES!!!**  
    Usage as cool time:
    ```Javascript
    var x = 0
    while(true){
        //clear canvas
        SetColor("white")
        DrawRect(0, 0, GetCanvasSize()[0], GetCanvasSize()[1])

        //write "a"
        SetColor("black")
        DrawText("a", x, 100)

        //move
        x += 1

        //COOL TIME; FPS=60
        await sleep(1000/60)
    }
    ```
    In short words, write as `await sleep(...)`

    Technically, all the HTML/Browser events will operated within `sleep()`, so if you don't do this and keep busy, your page crashes.

* `Log()`
    Print your value to "console log" (chrome/edge: press F12 and see "console")

    Isn't it same as `console.log()`? This is for beginners!!!

* `ImportScript()`
    If you want to divide your scripts to multiple file, use this.

* `CopyArray()`
    Do you know "pass by reference"?
    ```Javascript
    var a = [1, 2]
    var b = a
    a[1] = 3
    DrawText(a, 100, 100) //<-This shows [1, 3]
    ```

    To prevent this, this function is helpful.

#### For geeks wondering about the coding style.
This library is focusing on **for beginners**, not for geeks.  
For beginners, I want to
* hide class, not like `HSS.DrawText()`, make it as global function. (No problem for users to use class for their own)
* Complete-single-thread, not using HTML events. For no confusion, and for flame-based comprehensive program experience.
